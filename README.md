# Very Handy Weather App

**See the whole thing working here: [vickylai.com/handy-weather-app](http://vickylai.com/handy-weather-app/)**

My first(!) full-fledged browser app. Shows weather and background photo based on ip address location.

Created initially for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/vickylaixy)'s Front-End Developer Certification Course. The first (not actively maintained) version is on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/vickylaixy/full/jBXgeR/).
